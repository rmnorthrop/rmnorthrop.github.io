# **Completing Lab 1**

### Process
In completing Lab 1, the first frustrating problem I ran into was deleting the sample posts prior to creating a new post, which resulted in the disappearance/deletion of the entire posts folder. This resulted in having to delete my forked theme and start over. I'm glad I realized this order of operations quirk at the beginning of the process, rather than having to delete and recreate a repository after having added content.

Navigating where things live in a github repository is already very different from using Wordpress or another template-based website creator. The fact that folders and sub folders have the same name "assets" is confusing, and I can see the fingerprints of the people who built the theme in how things are or are not organized. I also found out that tags for posts are case sensitive, so that by tagging two posts as "Test" and "test" I inadvertently generated two tag categories. I'm sure there are many little quirks (I don't know what else to call them) that will come up when working with a new software. 

I've also found that copying and pasting the markdown from existing posts/pages does not necessarily generate an instant result. I copied the markdown lines for a post with a header image, but I have not yet been able to generate a post with a header image. I made sure to save my image files in my repo as jpgs of the same size as photos that are already there and I put them in folders where other images used in sample pages etc live. Still, the images do not show up on the post and I'm not sure why. When working "cold" with a new program, I find it frustrating when I don't know what to do next to troubleshoot. The same thing happend with trying to create a new page that would appear on the top menu bar like the "About" page appears. I tried to mimic the markdown for the About page, but it includes a whole configuration section for different languages, which I don't think I need. I found all the sample page layouts with their yml front matter, but I realized I needed to go into _data/navigation.yml to change what appears on the menu bar. I know that's the place where something needs to change, but I tried the "url" as /biopage and as /biopage.html (the file is biopage.md, comprable to about.md). The front matter in biopage.md follows the sample for a single-column page/article. Ultimately, I am not sure why neither the header image nor the new "Bio" page are working, so I was not able to overcome those challenges. The only successful change I made beyond uploading a new text-only post was to change the theme's skin from "default" to "forest."

### Goals

Beginning with the end in mind, I've been thinking more about the final data set I'd like to create. I'm still considering compiling a bibliography of literature published in the 1970s (currently a many-tabbed spreadsheet on my computer) that I mentioned in my introductory survey. Reading the Rosenberg piece and seeing the Priestly's 1772 infographic, I realized the final data vizualization I'm imagining creating from such a dataset is an idea that is well over 200 years old. So maybe one of my goals is to take DH 200 years back in time to the age of big scrolls of paper and to use the tools of today to create data visualizations that could be printed as wall-sized charts. Last semester Katie introduced me to Miro, a site that is essentially an infinite blank space in which you can create mind maps of text boxes and arrows that bend and curve. In thinking about access and how not only DH research tools but also the final result of DH projects (like Periscopic's "Stolen years" website that needs internet connection and graphics rendering power to view). Off-line infographics, like the *Washington Post* bar chart, are associated with incomplete data collection or clunky rendering. Because I'm not someome who ultimately likes to spend time in front of a screen, I think one of my running goals for the semester will be to think about off-line, hard copy iterations of DH work (the book *Data Feminism* is a great example of that, I think. I bought the hard copy of the book and the photographs, screenshots, charts, maps, and other visuals are beautifully rendered in full color on heavy paper). Of course there is also a cost-barrier to accessing these kinds of printed materials, but I like the idea of thinking of DH as a kind of data-supported or data-created art. 
 
In Fall 2020 as part of Dr. Munro's Lit Theory class we all hand wrote tags for the [Hostile Terrain 94](https://www.undocumentedmigrationproject.org/hostileterrain94/) installation in the library's Learning Commons. The project used existing GIS mapping data documenting the deaths of undocumented migrants in the Sonoran Desert along the US-Mexico border to create a DIY art installation that organizations around the world have installed in their galleries, schools, and institutions. In this case, the [website with the interactive GIS map](https://humaneborders.info/app/map.asp) is the starting point rather than the end point. It's also interesting how the DH articles we've read so far still rely on conventions of academic prose writing. Another goal for the semester might be to think about what it would look like to write an academic article as lines of code, as a series of graphs and charts with captions only, or other alternative form of information sharing. 

So far these are thoughful ideas about goals. Looking at the readings and labs we will be completing this semester, specific and accomplishable goals are:
- understand regular expressions and how to use them with spreadsheets
- become familiar with the kinds of humanities datasets that have already been created and are available for reference/use
- come up with a few concrete ways to DH tools/resources/skills into future undergraduate teaching
- create a final dataset that in some way uses the data I've already collected during preliminary data research
