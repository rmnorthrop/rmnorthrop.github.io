# Completing Lab 1

### Process
In completing Lab 1, the first frustrating problem I ran into was deleting the sample posts prior to creating a new post, which resulted in the disappearance/deletion of the entire posts folder. This resulted in having to delete my forked theme and start over. I'm glad I realized this order of operations quirk at the beginning of the process, rather than having to delete and recreate a repository after having added content.

Navigating where things live in a github repository is already very different from using Wordpress or another template-based website creator. The fact that folders and sub folders have the same name "assets" is confusing, and I can see the fingerprints of the people who built the theme in how things are or are not organized. I also found out that tags for posts are case sensitive, so that by tagging two posts as "Test" and "test" I inadvertently generated two tag categories. I'm sure there are many little quirks (I don't know what else to call them) that will come up when working with a new software. 

I've also found that copying and pasting the markdown from existing posts/pages does not necessarily generate an instant result. I copied the markdown lines for a post with a header image, but I have not yet been able to generate a post with a header image. I made sure to save my image files in my repo as jpgs of the same size as photos that are already there and I put them in folders where other images used in sample pages etc live. Still, the images do not show up on the post and I'm not sure why. When working "cold" with a new program, I find it frustrating when I don't know what to do next to troubleshoot. The same thing happend with trying to create a new page that would appear on the top menu bar like the "About" page appears. I tried to mimic the markdown for the About page, but it includes a whole configuration section for different languages, which I don't think I need. I also tried copying the markdown for sample pages (sometimes called "Articles" in the
