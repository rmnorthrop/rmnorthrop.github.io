Rachel is a second year PhD student in the English department at the University of Miami. Her research explores the narrations of value, value transfer, embodiment, and ancestral deep time in 1970s American literature together with financial documents of the same period.

Rachel holds an MA in English from the City College of New York (2016) and a BS in Secondary English Education from New York University (2010). She worked as a tutor and teacher in New York City public schools from 2006-2018 and a freelance writer for the coffee trade from 2012-2020. Rachel dances as part of the Sikan Afrocuban Dance Project in Miami and has training in ballet, modern, Afro-Brazilian, and Afro-Cuban dance. Her experiences on coffee farms in Latin America, in public education classrooms, and as a lifelong student of dance inform her work as a reader, writer, and hopeful scholar.
